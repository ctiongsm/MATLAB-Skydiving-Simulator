# MATLAB-Skydiving-Simulator
SIMULATOR IS TO BE RUN ON MATLAB programs. Convert code to MATLAB compiler to test and use

 - Goal: Input user variables and calculate a unique freefall in three dimensions

- Steps:
  1. Input user variables when prompted (i.e. weight, height, desired jump height)
  2. Jump will be analytically and grahically calculated
  3. Click/ enter point when you want to deploy parachute
  4. Program will continue to analyze and graph free fall
  5. Output jump distance and time
  
- Notes:
  1. Average skydive height=15000 ft (input)
  2. % = comments
